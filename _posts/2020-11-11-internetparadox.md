Let's go back in time to 1998. I see that a paper was published about a phenomenon called Internet Paradox. 
I am curious to read it, but first I can't open it because my dial-up internet access with around 56kbps download speed does not allow me to download. 
If it magically does, it is definite that the paper won't be on Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar etc., because the concept of content-sharing is not common yet. 
So, I can wait for 10 years to read and to decide if I am depressed or not because of using the internet.

The main understanding about the proposed concept, Internet Paradox, is that the more time people spend behind the screens, 
the lonelier and more depressed they feel. The paper is basically a research report about the effect of the usage of the internet. 
At that time (like really long ago ~1998) people are using the internet for several reasons: increase their technical skills, 
socializing (yes without Facebook), commercial transactions etc., The report investigates the side-effects of using internet, 
and concluded that it is responsible for the increase rate of depression, because using internet make people vote less, have fewer social occasions, 
get together less for civic, even go to church less. The virtual interfaces replace the real faces and people feel more isolated and lonesome.

I wonder what would they think today? I spend around six hours on the screen listening to a lecture, coding, 
reading and then I spend another two hours watching, entertaining. It is true that I may become less social, but who said I am more depressed? 
I was always depressed enough :/Anyhow, Internet Paradox got my attention. To be honest, I didn't read the paper quite well because 
I didn't find a free version of the paper (I may become more depressed because of it). 

I will continue on my voyage to 1998 and figure out what the authors were looking for and also what the authors are thinking today.

PS: I found a [critic about the paper](https://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=334533), and will summarize it later.
