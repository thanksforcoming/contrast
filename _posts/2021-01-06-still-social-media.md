Eventually, we come to who we are on social media. The thing is you can be whoever you want in this imaginary world, but you can't hide. 
You still reflect your emotions, your thoughts even if you try to be someone very cool, very happy and very healthy. You know there are people who try to understand your thoughts even from your choice of social media platform.While just searching on the internet, I came across several pages that are characterizing people by their favorite social media apps. Apparently, you are very nostalgic if you are still using facebook and very sociable if your choice is snapchat. 
I don't know how they came with these results. For example,  I can make one too. If you are using Twitter more than others,you are ... , a very sensitive person and tomorrow will be your day... Oops I went too far. 
I don't know if your favorite  social media depends on your characteristics.  
What I believe is the things that we share on social media can reflect our  emotions, our depression and our characteristics. 

[A study from Harvard](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03282.pdf) showed that Instagram posts can reveal depression.Their dataset contains 166 participants with 45M photos, but their results are notable.  For example, when someone is depressed, he/she tends to use bluer, darker filters. 
The model is able to diagnose a depressed person with 70% accuracy. I am thinking about my photos and the filter that I used, the result is not good. I tend to use the darker ones, I wonder why? 

Be careful before changing your status at Facebook, because you can be narcissistic  according to [the study from Brunel University](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886915003025).If you like to upload photos from your gym, you can think of yourself as a narcissist. Of course, everybody loves the attention, the likes, the comments etc. but if you tend to change your status frequently and upload photos about your achievement and demand attention every time,  then you can be. But what is wrong with being a narcissist anyway, I don't know ask yourself.Of course you are not easily labeled as narcissistic just because you post too much. The people arevery complex, even without any narcissistic disorders people tend to put their ego and personal desires in the first place. 
The frequent post desires may just be the result of your polite friends who desire to see you everyday, every hour, every minute.who are they?
What about the people posting about their relationships? I don't want to know about their relationship. It is like being an online third wheel :/ 
In the study, it has been shown that posting about the relationship can be related to low self-esteem and the insecurities about the relationships.   

I wonder what personality I would be assigned to not to post anything on social media or not to use social media. 
Nowadays using social media is considered as a standard and not using it as surprising. 
I don't think that not using makes you weird, antisocial, courageous, happy, sad etc. 
I closed my Facebook account two years ago, because I started to think that I don't use it very well, so that I am not giving enough 
data to Mark Zukerberg. I feel responsible and reject the use of Facebook for free :/ 
Nowadays I use Instagram and Twitter, because I am a sweet, funny person and have a lavish lifestyle with my new Louboutins.
