I recently watched [Social Dilemma on Netflix](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/). The documentary is about the impact of the social networks in our daily lives and explains the "_heros_" behind it. The main claim is that the social networks are damaging our  daily lives by promising us connection, knowledge, popularity, and behind all these systems there are homogenous groups of people, mainly white men, who are building algorithms that run the networks. 

The plot starts with Tristan Harris who was a former Google Ethicist. He defined the social network as "_simultaneous utopia and dystopia_", 
which also defines the title of the documentary. The story in the film continues with the interview of the former employees in the tech-companies and several scientists. They are explaining how their good intentions turned out to be bad influences on the social network (ex: like button on Facebook). The film states that social media is a useful tool: it assures long distance communication,  unlimited knowledge. However the companies collect users' data and build models to predict user actions, even sell the data to advertisement companies (like Facebook did). With stating the bad sides of these big companies, the film tries to create an awareness of these social media. 

Despite their good intentions, there are some critics about the documentary, like Maria Farrell. She pointed out in [her article](https://conversationalist.org/2020/03/05/the-prodigal-techbro/) that these tech-bros are choosing an easy way to redemption and use this situation in their advance. Like saying "_I was lost but now I’m found, please come to my TED talk_". She is right about the lack of important voices in the documentary. There are scientists who are working in these subjects for years, it could have also given time to the scholars like  Safiya Noble, Sarah T. Roberts, Nighat Dad, Gus Hosein. A documentary on Netflix is a good chance to exploit the important studies, and they could have given a chance to these scholars. 

Another point given by the documentary, is to blame the social network for the health issues of the GenZ. Several studies showed that mental health issues raised because of the usage of social media, but according to 
Sonia Livingstone, the economic situation and climate change can also cause health issues in young people. Finally, the film even suggests logging off social media, by pointing out that even tech-employees don't let their children use social media. 

Despite the critic voices and their rightfulness, the film shows you that "_if you are not paying for the product, then you are the product_" and it could make people more aware of the usage and the effect of social media.
