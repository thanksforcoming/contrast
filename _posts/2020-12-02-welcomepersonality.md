This week, I got my inspiration from another [blog post about MBTI](https://gitlab.com/uskudarli/ssw2020/-/wikis/oznur-akyuz/weekly-blog/Are-You-an-Extrovert-or-Introvert%3F).

There are two types of people... No, I won't start my weekly blog with a joke.
Really how many types of people are there in the world? 
According to Myers-Briggs, there are 16 types. How accurate!

Myers and Briggs were mother and daughter, who created Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. 
It is a well-known test to classify people into 16 classes. 
The test basically contains questions with two options. 
It is a self-indicator, meaning that you are testing yourself. 
I was unaware of the test and how widely it is used until I found a dataset about it on Kaggle ([MBTI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type)). 
I will explain the dataset later, let's clear out some facts about the indicator.

The test stems from the ideas of Carl Jung. 
From his clinical studies, he divided human psychological functions into four classes: sensation, intuition, feeling and thinking. 
Each person is dominated by one of these classes. 
For example, people are either energized by the external world (Extra-version) or their own internal world (Intro-version). 
Also, the creator of the test had no formal training in psychology. 
The thing about his ideas is that they were not tested by controlled experiments. 
I know that you would say isn't it true for most of the psychological theorems. 
Maybe, but Jung's ideas about human personality classes are disregarded by the psychology community.

**What is wrong with these groups?**

It doesn't work like this in the real world. 
I mean some day you feel very social and very sensitive; but suddenly your mood changes because of a tiny small virus. 
I know the chance of being depressed because of a virus is highly low, but who knows.
Also, the test is not reliable; because it can produce different results for the same person. 
Several studies showed that 50% of all the test takers are classified differently when re-tested [1]. 
The test is built entirely around the basis that people fall in one class or another. 
Even Jung himself admitted that __there is no such thing as a pure extra vert or a pure introvert. Such a man would be in the lunatic asylum.__ 

MBTI is a very popular tool used by the recruiters. 
They use the test to understand the applicant's personality and they make assumptions using the test result.
It is not completely meaningless, but it is true that just four letters doesn't justify our personality.

With all these counter guests, I used MBTI data set to classify social media users. 
You can find the code and my result in the following link: [PersonalityPrediction](https://github.com/mmerveunlu/PersonalityPrediction). 
There are controversial points about this classification. 
First, we are not sure how accurate MBTI indicator is since it is a self-indicator and can produce different results. 
How can we be sure that our data set is labeled correctly? 
Second, we assume that people act the same in social media as in the real world, then we use their posts to classify them. 
If we only want social media profiles, then we don't need to think about the real world profiles. 
This point makes me think about the differences between social media and real world profiles. How do we behave in these two worlds?
