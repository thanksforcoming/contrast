I finally read the paper about Internet Paradox. One important thing that I noticed is that the word "paradox" has been used twice in the context, (one is in the title).The meaning of Internet Paradox in the paper is explained as follows: 
Even though the internet is a social technology and we use it to communicate, it decreases the social interaction and causes our depression. 
This is their claim, not mine. I am very happy with my unsocial-social online imaginary friends. 
The sample community who participated in the experiments consisted of 93 families, 256 individuals including teens and children. 
The authors collected data for 1-2 years including automatically recorded Internet usage. 
They associated the increases in internet usage with declines in social involvement which causes loneliness, which causes depression. Imagine today's world, if the research claims are true. 

Thankfully, there are some missing points in the research. For example there is no control group which is an essential point of an experiment. 
Without a control group, you can't be sure about the validity of the experiment. 
They blamed the increase in depression, the loneliness and decrease in social involvement to Internet usage by assuming every other variable in the environment is the same? 
What about the economical status of the time? Also, they evaluated the data with self-report of the participants. 
The self-questionnaire measured the social involvement and psychological well being. 
The first question that comes to my mind is the way to define loneliness. 
Did they ask if the participants feel lonely or what? How do you measure loneliness?  The problem with the Internet comes when face-to-face interaction 
is replaced by digital communication. In the paper, they concluded that one can't build 
a deep/true relation with another online, so goodbye cyberFriends, bye-bye facebook friends that I met on AuwCatLoversOriginalGroup. Virtual interfaces can't replace the real faces. 

I know the paper is old and doesn't hold many scientific results, at least for me since I don't live in the USA 
and I am already depressed enough. The research reveals the questions about the Internet that we are facing today. 
We are in quarantine and our face-to-face connections are minimized so that I lost a discussion to my cat on what to watch tonight, because she wanted to watch IT Crowd 
again.  Here is a link for you, so that you can enter the endless loop of watching IT Crowd. [IT Crowd - FriendFace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4o2PDwKdcA)
