Social bots refer to the automated account that can post content without any human supervision. They are trained to use social networks as humans did. 
They can be used to answer questions or find relevant information, even help customers. 
There are useful bots, like [Earthquake Robot](https://twitter.com/earthquakebot?lang=en) reports the earthquakes 
or [hi i have advice](https://twitter.com/nice_tips_bot) shares life tips. 
They can even enter discussion about politics, that would be my father's favorite: a  tireless competitor. 
Of course, the idea of these bots is not to discuss the politics with my father. 
The truth is that they are not just the number anymore, they can manipulate humans, can alter news and spread misinformation. 

There is a research about the role of the social bots in spreading fake news [1]. 
The social bots are programmed to focus on more influential users. 
With this strategy, the fake news spreads easily, because the popular users can be fooled by the bots and willingly share fake news.
A research report revealed that 2/3 shared links on Twitter are from bots [2]. 
They have collected 1.2 English tweets and followed the link locations. 
Then, they have used a tool called Botometer [3] to identify the bots. 
They have concluded that the bots are mostly sharing links about adult content, sports and commercial products. 
The study is just about the shared links, so we are not sure about the content of the tweets actually. 
I will not even write about the elections and how people can be fooled by bots [4].

In commercial products, the bots are used to share fake experience: like comments about a product. 
For example, you search for a product online, and check the other users' comments about it. 
You can't be sure if the comments are from real human experience, or they are just from automated bots that are programmed to create fake comments, 
especially five/four star comments. Sorry, but it is not very convincing that there are 20K people who have commented on a single water glass.
